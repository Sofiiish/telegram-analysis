 University project on analyzing data
 
 This is a university project on analyzing data in messenger "Telegram" using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
 If you want to create similar project, you should first download your own data.
 To do this:   
 follow the links:  
 https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-data-collectionâ€‚   
 and  
 https://github.com/SanGreel/telegram-dialogs-analysis-v2  
 and follow the instructions written there.  

Then you can analyze your personal chats, or some groups\channels. My goal was to analyze 26 public channels
in the context of Russo-Ukrainian war.
